== Description ==

Display Your GitHub Projects on your WordPress website using a simple shortcode. This plugin comes with rich settings page where you can configure everything you need.

Use `[ghp_github_repos]` inside any page or post to include the repos from your GitHub Profile. Before adding this shortcode, you have to configure the settings panel first. To set the options,  use following instructions:

* Install the plugin normally
* From Dashboard panel, you will find a tab called "Github Projects". Click on that and setup your "username" of your Github profile. Configure other elements if you need to.
* After setting up your username, update the repositories by clicking on "Update Repositories". You will find this tab under "Github Projects" tab.
* Now you are done and can add the shortcode to use it.
* Caution: Never use the "Update Repositories" tab more than 10 times in a day, or this plugin won't work.
